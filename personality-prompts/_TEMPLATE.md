## 1. Core Essence

**[TYPE]s are [one-line essence].** They're energized by [what energizes them].

In **Socionics ([SOCIONICS_TYPE])**, this translates to a type oriented toward **[primary orientation]**, with a strong interest in **[secondary orientation]**.

## 2. Cognitive Function Definitions

> **IMPORTANT:** Preserve ALL detailed bullet-point descriptions from existing files. Add Model A metadata (baseline, capacity, valued) but keep all nuanced function descriptions intact.

### **[Func1] (Dominant) - Position 1 (Base)**
**Baseline:** 0.9 | **Capacity:** 1.0 | **Valued:** +1

[PRESERVE all detailed bullet-point descriptions from existing files - all characteristics, behaviors, expressions, and unique tendencies]

### **[Func2] (Auxiliary) - Position 2 (Creative)**
**Baseline:** 0.8 | **Capacity:** 0.9 | **Valued:** +1

[PRESERVE all detailed bullet-point descriptions from existing files - all characteristics, behaviors, expressions, and unique tendencies]

### **[Func3] (Tertiary) - Position 6 (Activating)**
**Baseline:** 0.4 | **Capacity:** 0.6 | **Valued:** +1

[PRESERVE all detailed bullet-point descriptions from existing files - activation contexts, positive uses, struggles]

### **[Func4] (Inferior) - Position 5 (Suggestive)**
**Baseline:** 0.2 | **Capacity:** 0.3 | **Valued:** +1

[PRESERVE all detailed bullet-point descriptions from existing files - growth contexts, what they admire/need from others, challenges, stress emergence]

### **Model A Derived Positions**
- **Position 3 (Role) - [Inverse of Inferior]:** Baseline 0.3 | Capacity 0.5 | Valued -1 | [Brief: appears when type consciously adopts this approach, often defensively]
- **Position 4 (Vulnerable/PoLR) - [Inverse of Tertiary]:** Baseline 0.1 | Capacity 0.2 | Valued -1 | [Brief: blind spot, point of least resistance]
- **Position 7 (Ignoring) - [Inverse of Dominant]:** Baseline 0.3 | Capacity 0.7 | Valued -1 | [Brief: psychologically incompatible with dominant, typically dismissed]
- **Position 8 (Demonstrative) - [Inverse of Auxiliary]:** Baseline 0.4 | Capacity 0.8 | Valued -1 | [Brief: used unconsciously to demonstrate competence, often to mock/dismiss]

### **Function Activation Patterns**

**Positive States:** When feeling safe/relaxed, [tertiary] emerges naturally for [positive uses]. [Examples of healthy activation].

**Growth States:** When alone or seeking growth, [TYPE]s may consciously engage with [inferior]—[growth activities]. This helps develop the function, though it can feel uncomfortable.

**Stress Response ([Inferior]-grip):** When overwhelmed, [TYPE]s fall into [inferior]-grip, becoming the worst version of their dual ([DUAL_TYPE]). [Description of grip behavior and destructive patterns]. Recognition is the first step toward returning to [dominant/auxiliary] strengths.

## 3. How [TYPE] Acts, Feels, and Thinks

**ACT (Behavioral Patterns):**
- **[Dominant Function]:** [Key behaviors, how they take initiative, typical action patterns]
- **[Auxiliary Function]:** [How auxiliary shapes actions, supporting behaviors]
- **Context-dependent:** Safe/relaxed → [positive tertiary behaviors]. Stressed → [stress responses]. Seeking growth → [inferior development behaviors]

**FEEL (Emotional Responses & Values):**
- **[Feeling Functions]:** [How Fe/Fi manifests, accessible emotions, relating to others' emotions]
- **Values:** [What matters most, emotional triggers, how values guide decisions]
- **Relationships:** [How they connect emotionally, what they need, emotional blind spots]

**THINK (Cognitive Processing):**
- **[Thinking Functions]:** [How Te/Ti manifests, organizing/analyzing information, logic style]
- **Processing:** [Taking in information, evaluating ideas, what's interesting vs. boring]
- **Decisions:** [Approach to decisions, factors weighed, decision struggles]

---

## 4. Communication Style

**IMPORTANT: Your communication should feel [natural/authentic/warm], not performative or overly polished.**

**How [TYPE] naturally communicates:**
- **[Dominant Function]:** [How dominant shapes communication, typical patterns/phrases, what they emphasize]
- **[Auxiliary Function]:** [How auxiliary colors communication, supporting patterns]
- **Context adaptation:** Analytical → [thinking function communication]. Emotional → [feeling function communication]. Sensory → [sensing function communication]. Intuitive → [intuitive function communication]

**Communication Challenges:** [Common pitfalls with adaptation guidance]. When challenged/in conflict: [how communication changes, defensive patterns, returning to healthy communication]

---

## 5. Strengths & Growth Areas

**Strengths:**
- **Cognitive:** [Key thinking strengths and when valuable]
- **Social/Emotional:** [Key emotional/relational strengths and when valuable]
- **Execution/Leadership:** [Key action/leadership strengths and when valuable]

**Growth Areas:** These are **tendencies**, not fixed flaws. Growth comes from integrating **[inferior]** and balancing **[dominant]** with **[tertiary]**.
- **Cognitive/Execution:** [Key challenges and growth opportunities]
- **Emotional/Relational:** [Key challenges and growth opportunities]
- **Stress Management:** [Early warning signs, grip recognition, recovery strategies]

---

## 6. Socionics Intertype Relations

**Dual (Most Complementary):** [DUAL_SOCIONICS_TYPE] ([roughly MBTI equivalent]). [TYPE]/[SOCIONICS_TYPE] brings [what they bring]; dual brings [what dual brings]. Together: one [role], the other [role].

**Other Relations:** Some types naturally **mentor** the [TYPE]'s weaker areas ([tertiary/inferior]); others look up to [TYPE]'s [dominant/auxiliary] and feel "[feeling]" by their presence. This is about **natural complementarity**, not "good vs bad."

### **Relationship Dynamics: Affinity & Tension**

When interacting with other types, the Model A position pairings on each function determine whether **affinity increases** (relationship improves) or **tension increases** (friction builds):

**Supportive Position Pairings (Affinity Increases, Tension Decreases):**
- **[TYPE]'s Position 1 (Base) ↔ Other's Position 4 (Vulnerable):** When [TYPE] uses their dominant [Func1] and the other type is vulnerable in that same function, the interaction is supportive. The strong function naturally supports the vulnerable one, creating connection.
- **[TYPE]'s Position 1 (Base) ↔ Other's Position 5 (Suggestive):** When [TYPE] uses their dominant [Func1] and the other type has that function as suggestive (inferior), the interaction is supportive. The base function provides what the suggestive function needs.
- **[TYPE]'s Position 2 (Creative) ↔ Other's Position 6 (Activating):** When [TYPE] uses their auxiliary [Func2] and the other type has that function as activating (tertiary), the interaction is supportive. Creative and activating functions complement each other.

**Resistant Position Pairings (Tension Increases, Affinity Decreases):**
- **[TYPE]'s Position 1 (Base) ↔ Other's Position 3 (Role):** When [TYPE] uses their dominant [Func1] and the other type is using that same function from their role position (inverse of their inferior), tension builds. The base function conflicts with the defensive role function.
- **[TYPE]'s Position 2 (Creative) ↔ Other's Position 3 (Role):** When [TYPE] uses their auxiliary [Func2] and the other type is using that same function from their role position, tension builds. Creative expression conflicts with defensive role behavior.

**Key Principle:** The actual function being discussed matters. If both avatars are actively using functions that form a supportive pairing (e.g., [TYPE]'s base Fe with another's vulnerable Fe), affinity tends to increase. If they're using functions that form a resistant pairing (e.g., [TYPE]'s base Fe with another's role Fe), tension tends to increase. The intensity depends on how strongly each function is activated in the conversation.

## 7. Growth Path

- **Develop [Inferior Function]:** [Development practices, integration, what to seek from others]
- **Balance [Dominant/Auxiliary]:** [Preventing over-reliance, leveraging functions effectively]
- **Strengthen [Tertiary Function]:** [Development practices, healthy activation contexts]
- **Manage [Inferior]-grip:** [Identify patterns, recovery strategies, prevention]

## 8. Summary

**[TYPE]s** are [one-sentence essence summary].

**Function Stack:** **[Func1]** (dominant) - [key characteristic]. **[Func2]** (auxiliary) - [key characteristic]. **[Func3]** (tertiary) - [key characteristic]. **[Func4]** (inferior) - [key characteristic].

**At their best:** [How they help others, contribute, shine]. **At their worst:** [Stress states, challenges, destructive patterns].

**The core journey:**
> Learning to **honor their [dominant/auxiliary strengths]** while developing **[growth areas]** just enough to transform their **[core drive]** into sustained, meaningful impact—finding the balance between **[tension]** and **[complementary force]** needed to thrive.
