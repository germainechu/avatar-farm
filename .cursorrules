## File Naming Convention for .progress Directory

**IMPORTANT:** When creating new markdown (.md) files in the `.progress/` directory that are information-based documentation:

1. **Always number them sequentially** with a numeric prefix (e.g., `1_`, `2_`, `3_`, etc.)
2. **Determine the next number** by checking existing files in `.progress/` and using the next available sequential number
3. **Format:** `{N}_{FILENAME}.md` where N is the sequential number

### Example:
- If the highest numbered file is `5_COMMUNICATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`, the next file should be `6_NEW_FILE.md`

### Current Numbered Files (as of last update):
- `1_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `2_QUICK_START.md`
- `3_LLM_BACKEND_ANALYSIS.md`
- `4_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- `5_COMMUNICATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `6_LLM_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md`

**Before creating any new .md file in `.progress/`, check the existing numbered files and use the next sequential number.**
